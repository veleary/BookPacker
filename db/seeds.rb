# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


book1 = Book.create(filename: "book1.html")


# book1.read_booklist("book1.html")

# book2 = Book.create()
# book2.read_booklist(book2.html)

# book3 = Book.create()
# book3.read_booklist(book3.html)

# book4 = Book.create()
# book4.read_booklist(book4.html)

# book5 = Book.create()
# book5.read_booklist(book5.html)

# book6 = Book.create()
# book6.read_booklist(book6.html)
